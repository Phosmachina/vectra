## 🎯 Overview

The main goal of the project is to create a versatile multi-language template and toolkit
for website servers and backend systems. It strives to achieve this by integrating the
best existing technologies, resulting in an efficient and fast server experience. The 
goal is to minimize the complexity of development as much as possible. Ultimately, 
Vectra's goal is to leverage the unique design of each technology to achieve specific 
goals without investing excessive time and effort.

By combining these technologies, Vectra offers a robust and streamlined development
environment. It reduces the need for complex setups and integrations, allowing you to
focus on building the core functionality and design of your website.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisite

- Docker

### Install Vectra

```shell
go install github.com/Phosmachina/Vectra@latest
```
### Deploy

```shell
vectra -p path/YourProject init
```

Edit the configuration, `YourProject/.vectra/project.yml`, as your convenience.

Run `vectra` for a full generation:
```shell
vectra -p path/YourProject gen
```

```shell
{ \
  docker build -t phosmachina/autoprefixer -f '.pipe/Autoprefixer.Dockerfile' . ;\
  docker build -t phosmachina/pug -f '.pipe/Pug.Dockerfile' . ;\
  docker build -t phosmachina/sass_scss -f '.pipe/Sass&SCSS.Dockerfile' . \
}
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Your contributions are always valued and appreciated!

Thank you in advance for making this project even better. I'm excited to see your
contributions!

## 🕘 What's next

Improving and expanding this project is my perpetual goal.
Here's an insight into what I plan next:

- **HTML / Sass default components**: In the future, I plan to incorporate a set of
  default components into the project. This will help in establishing a
  consistent UI/UX throughout and will also save time and effort in design and
  development.
- **RBAC, ACL robust system**: Replace the current system with a robust and proven
  system like Casbin. This integration should help to deal with complex access management.

I value your ideas, contributions, and feedback. Stay tuned for the next steps on this
exciting journey!
